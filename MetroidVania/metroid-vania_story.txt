idea 1:
spider seeks power, makes deal with evil thing and has to fight spider god, 
loses and spider god says you didnt earn these things and takes it all away but says if you learn your error will give those back and more



gets angry at spider god and wants to kill her
starts to realize error of ways and wants to kill the evil thing eventually

start with mostly everything, but spider is super egotistical and has character defects
by overcoming the defect you can then use its power

shrink - humility, belittle self

missile  - 

web shot - slow your mind and think 

scatter shot - multiple solutions for every problem, 

wall climb - 

venom shot - resentment

grapple/web swing - 

shoot through walls - foresight of seeing through obsticles

grenade - 

high jump - 

double jump - 

upgrades to main weapon damage to make it worth using?
or prevent weapon 0 to be used when get scatter and shoot through walls
upgrades to all weapons damage/effect?

each power up represents a defect 
gets all powers 

or each boss represents a defect but how does tie in to losing everything
realizes each defect when beaten


idea 2:
very simple story but metaphore for something
